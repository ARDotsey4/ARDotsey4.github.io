title: "Huffman Encoder/Decoder"
excerpt: "This is a program I made based on the principles of Huffman Encoding as a recreational proof of concept. It is written in Python and uses priority queues (min heaps) to convert the content of .txt documents into binary string based on the frequencies of ASCII characters within the document. In essence, the program creates unique encryption cyphers for individual text files."
